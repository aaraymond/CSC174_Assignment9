			<h2>About Godiva</h2>
            <p>Godiva Chocolatier is a manufacturer of premium fine chocolates and related products. Godiva, founded in Belgium in 1926, was purchased by the Turkish Yıldız Holding, owner of the Ülker Group, on November 20, 2007.Godiva owns and operates more than 600 retail boutiques and shops in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia and is available via over 10,000 specialty retailers.

            <p>In addition to chocolates, Godiva also sells truffles, coffee, cocoa, biscuits, dipped fruits and sweets, chocolate liqueur, shakes, wedding and party favors and other items arranged in gift baskets. Godiva's signature package is the Gold Ballotin (French for "small, cardboard box of chocolates"). Godiva also produces seasonal and limited-edition chocolates with special packaging for major holidays. Godiva also has license agreements for the production of ice cream, cheesecake, coffee pods and liqueur that comes in several chocolate-related flavors. Products are also available in sugar-free and Kosher varieties.</p>
            <p>It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days. </p>
            
            <p>Godiva continues to own and operate more than 450 shops worldwide.The company issues six seasonal mail-order catalogs a year in the USA and also accepts online and telephone orders for their products. Godiva chocolate is also sold in local malls and mini shops.</p>
            
            <p>Godiva opened (May 2012) Café Godiva in London’s Harrod’s Department Store. The 40-plus table venue features Godiva’s chocolate beverages, pastries, and chocolates. The company also has a store in the Harrods Food Hall.</p>
			<h2>BEGINNINGS IN BRUSSELS</h2>

			<p>Over 75 years ago, Godiva began as a small praline-making business run by the Draps family out of their home in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
			<p>The company was called Chocolaterie Draps until Joseph Draps decided he wanted to produce a more exclusive chocolate and open up a chocolate shop.</p>
			<p>One of the first Godiva shops still stands in the beautiful, historic Grand Place in Brussels.</p>

 
			<h2>WHAT'S IN A NAME?</h2>

			<p>Draps selected the name Godiva for his chocolate company. His inspiration came from the well-known Saxon legend of Lady Godiva who rode unclothed through the streets of Coventry to entreat her husband, Leofric the Dane, to lower taxes. 
			<p>Her courage prevailed, and in Europe she was celebrated in countless works of art. Little did Joseph Draps realize that over time his chocolate would become as legendary as the lady herself.</p>

 
			<h2>COMING TO AMERICA</h2>

			<p>In 1966, the Draps family came into contact with the American company Campbell Soup Company, which acquired one-third of a stake in Godiva that year.</p>
			<p>Thus, the American operation of the company was the first to introduce premium chocolate to the American palette. By 1968, Godiva Chocolatier, Inc., had begun domestic production, using the exclusive Belgian recipes.</p>
