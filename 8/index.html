                    <h3>Blending</h3>
                    <p>Chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couvertures. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla</li>
                        <li>Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla</li>
                        <li>White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conching</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/melanger.jpg" alt="Chocolate melanger">
                        <figcaption>Chocolate melanger conching and refining cocoa nibs into chocolate</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The penultimate process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conche">conching</a>. A conche is a surface scraping mixer and agitator that evenly distributes cocoa butter within chocolate, and may act as a 'polisher' of the particles. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 °C (113 to 122 °F) until final processing. </p>
                    <h3>Tempering</h3>
                    <p>The final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken. The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.</p>
                    <h3>Storage</h3>
                    <p>Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 °C (59 and 63 °F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. Various types of "<a href="https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/structural-changes-in-chocolate-blooming/">blooming</a>" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly. Fat bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 °C (75 °F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 °C (59 °F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. One can get rid of bloom by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate. </p>
                    <p>Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper.</p>
                    <p>If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption. </p>
